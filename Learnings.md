// Vite React
1. Use only JSX
2. Name all functions with capitalized letters (PascalCase).
3. Export every function created.
4. Ensure only one element is exported by wrapping all content within a single parent element, 
typically <></> (Fragment) or <div>.
example : 
return (
    <>  or <div>
    <First_function/>
    <h1>Hello World! with vite</h1>
    </> or </div>
  )

// React
1. Use PascalCase for naming files.
2. Export every function created.
3. Ensure only one element is exported by wrapping all content within a single parent element, typically <></> (Fragment) in the .js file.


// Best Practices
1. The folder names should start with a capital letter
2. Use .jsx for files returning HTML, and .js for standard JavaScript logic.


// tailwind css ( Guidelines )
1. Use className in JSX instead of class (which is used in regular JavaScript).
2. Always use the self-closing <img /> tag instead of <img>.
