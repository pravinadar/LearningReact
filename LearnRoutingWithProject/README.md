## 1. Created all the components.

### Header.jsx

- **`to="About"`**: The `to` prop in the `NavLink` specifies the path that the `NavLink` will navigate to when clicked.
  
- **`className={({ isActive }) => ... }`**: This function conditionally applies styles based on whether the link is active. If the link is the currently active route, it applies the class `text-orange-600`; otherwise, it applies `text-slate-700`. The `isActive` flag is provided by React Router to indicate whether the current route matches the `to` path.

### Layout.jsx

- **`Outlet`**: Imported from `react-router-dom`, `Outlet` is a special placeholder used in nested routing. It will render whatever child route is currently active within the layout.

```jsx
function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```
Layout Component Explanation:

The Layout component represents the general structure of the layout used throughout your app:

Header: Renders the Header component at the top of the page, likely containing elements like navigation links or branding.

Outlet: The Outlet component will render the child components that match the current route. For example, if the user navigates to the /about page, the About component will be rendered in place of Outlet.

Footer: Renders the Footer component, which stays static at the bottom of every page.

In the context of React Router, the Layout component provides a persistent structure for your application. Regardless of the route (e.g., /about, /contact), the Header and Footer remain the same. The only part that changes is the content between them, which is dynamically replaced by the component matched to the current route (rendered in the Outlet).

# Explanation of `main.jsx` and React Router Functions

## 1. Imports
**React Router Imports** :

- `createBrowserRouter`: Creates a router instance for handling routes in a web browser.

- `createRoutesFromElements`: Converts JSX elements (the route structure) into a route configuration object.

- `Route`: Represents a single route definition, defining the URL path and the component to render when that path is active.

- `RouterProvider`: Wraps the entire app and provides routing functionality, making the router features available throughout the application.

## 2. Router Setup

```jsx
const router = createBrowserRouter(
  createRoutesFromElements(
    <Route path='/' element={<Layout />}>
      <Route path='' element={<Home />} />
      <Route path='About' element={<About />} />
      <Route path='Contact' element={<Contact />} />
      <Route path='user/:userid' element={<User />} />
      <Route loader={githubInfoLoader} path='Github' element={<Github />} />
    </Route>
  )
);
```

`createBrowserRouter()`: Sets up a browser-based router for the application. It manages the URL history and allows navigation between different components based on the URL path.

`createRoutesFromElements()`: Allows defining routes using JSX syntax, making the route configuration more readable. The main route (path='/') uses the Layout component, and it contains the following nested routes:

`path=''`: Renders the Home component at the base URL (/).

`path='About'`: Renders the About component at /About.

`path='Contact'`: Renders the Contact component at /Contact.

`path='user/:userid'`: This is a dynamic route that allows passing a userid parameter. For example, navigating to /user/123 renders the User component, and the value 123 is accessible via parameters.

`path='Github'`: Renders the Github component and uses a loader (githubInfoLoader) to fetch data before the component is mounted.


```jsx
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```
`RouterProvider` : This component wraps your entire application and makes the routing system available. It manages routing state, listens to the URL, and renders the appropriate components based on the current route.

## How the Routing Works in This Project
The router is created using createBrowserRouter with routes defined in JSX via createRoutesFromElements.

The root route ('/') renders the Layout component, which contains static elements like a Header and Footer, but dynamically renders content based on the child routes inside an Outlet.

The app has multiple child routes (Home, About, Contact, User, and Github), each mapped to a specific URL path.

The RouterProvider wraps the entire app, making it aware of routing logic and enabling navigation between different routes.
