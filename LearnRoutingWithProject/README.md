## 1. Created all the components.

### Header.jsx

- **`to="About"`**: The `to` prop in the `NavLink` specifies the path that the `NavLink` will navigate to when clicked.
  
- **`className={({ isActive }) => ... }`**: This function conditionally applies styles based on whether the link is active. If the link is the currently active route, it applies the class `text-orange-600`; otherwise, it applies `text-slate-700`. The `isActive` flag is provided by React Router to indicate whether the current route matches the `to` path.

### Layout.jsx

- **`Outlet`**: Imported from `react-router-dom`, `Outlet` is a special placeholder used in nested routing. It will render whatever child route is currently active within the layout.

```jsx
function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

Layout Component Explanation:

The Layout component represents the general structure of the layout used throughout your app:

Header: Renders the Header component at the top of the page, likely containing elements like navigation links or branding.
Outlet: The Outlet component will render the child components that match the current route. For example, if the user navigates to the /about page, the About component will be rendered in place of Outlet.
Footer: Renders the Footer component, which stays static at the bottom of every page.

In the context of React Router, the Layout component provides a persistent structure for your application. Regardless of the route (e.g., /about, /contact), the Header and Footer remain the same. The only part that changes is the content between them, which is dynamically replaced by the component matched to the current route (rendered in the Outlet).
